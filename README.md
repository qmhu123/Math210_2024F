There are 2 parts. 

The "example_cnn.ipynb" is a jupyter note book you can use directly in google colab or anaconda jupyter notebook. 

Files in the matlab folder requres a matlab enviroment. I am using 2023b, but everything except from NeuralNetwork folder should run fine in not too old matlab environments. The cnn example in the NeuralNetwork folder requires deep learning tool box, you shold try it using matlab online. It is available to you for free if register using the university email address. 


Have fun!
